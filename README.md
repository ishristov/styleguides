# Front-end Style Guides

*Some generic style guides for writing cleaner and more consistent HTML, CSS and JavaScript.*

Consistency is the key for writing manageble, reusable and easy to read code. Feel free to use these style guides when starting a new project.

Keep in mind that whatever you read here, if you start working on an old project you should
always use the style guides that are already defined for that project,
even you don't agree with them. Always take the time to get used with the code 
and apply your coding style with it.
